      "Reputation & Team": "Based on the provided information, Hepsiburada has cultivated a formidable reputation as a leading and trusted e-commerce brand with a deeply entrenched geographical focus in Turkey. The company presents itself as \"Turkey's most recommended e-commerce brand\" and a \"household name\" that has been shaping the country's digital commerce landscape since its founding in the early 2000s. Its brand strength is further evidenced by a massive user base of approximately 50 million members and its public listing on the NASDAQ (HEPS), which signals a high level of corporate maturity and international financial credibility. Operationally, Hepsiburada's presence is unequivocally centered on the Turkish market, with its headquarters in Istanbul and its entire marketing narrative framed around serving Turkish consumers. While the company's affiliation with the prominent Doğan Holding and its status as a publicly-traded entity imply a structured and experienced leadership team, the provided materials offer no specific visibility into the management team itself. There is no mention of key executives, their expertise, or their public profiles, leaving an assessment of the team reliant on the overall success and reputation of the organization they lead.",
      "Company Overview & Strategy": "Based on the provided information, Hepsiburada is a pioneering and leading e-commerce platform in Turkey, operating since 2001 as part of Doğan Holding. The company's core strategy revolves around establishing itself as the most recommended digital shopping destination in the country by focusing on three key pillars: an extensive selection, competitive pricing, and fast, reliable delivery. Its business model is a hybrid one, combining a first-party Direct Sales (1P) approach with a third-party Marketplace (3P) that connects approximately 50 million members with over 100,700 active merchants. This model allows Hepsiburada to offer an immense variety of over 180 million SKUs across more than 35 categories, solidifying its brand promise of \"Everything is Here.\" The company targets a broad and diverse customer base, catering to virtually every consumer need, including technology enthusiasts seeking brands like Apple and Samsung; fashion-conscious individuals shopping for clothing, shoes, and accessories; families looking for mother and baby products from brands like Prima and Huggies; and homeowners sourcing everything from appliances and furniture to automotive parts and supermarket goods. Hepsiburada's revenue strategy is driven by high-volume sales, facilitated by aggressive pricing, surprise discounts, and a seamless shopping experience. A critical component of its strategy is its significant investment in a large, scalable, in-house logistics network with robust last-mile capabilities, exemplified by its \"Yarın Kapında\" (At Your Door Tomorrow) service. This operational strength, combined with its status as a publicly-traded company on NASDAQ (HEPS), underscores its position as a dominant force shaping the standards of e-commerce in Turkey.",
      "Technology & Practices": "Analysis failed",
      "SWOT Summary": "Based on the provided information, Hepsiburada's strategic position is defined by its significant strengths as a market leader, balanced by the inherent risks of its operational focus and the competitive landscape. The company's primary strength lies in its deep-rooted brand recognition and market dominance within Turkey, having operated since 2001 to become a household name with a massive base of approximately 50 million members and over 100,000 active merchants. This is supported by a formidable operational infrastructure, including a vast selection of over 180 million SKUs and a proprietary in-house logistics network capable of fast, next-day delivery, which solidifies its value proposition of selection, price, and convenience. However, this deep entrenchment in the Turkish market constitutes a potential weakness, creating a heavy dependency on a single economy and exposing the company to local economic volatility. This concentration risk is countered by clear opportunities for growth, including the continued expansion into high-frequency purchase categories like supermarket and pet supplies, and leveraging its technological capabilities and NASDAQ listing to explore international markets. Nonetheless, Hepsiburada faces persistent external threats from intense competition in the e-commerce sector, potential regulatory changes impacting digital commerce and data privacy, and the overarching risk of economic instability affecting consumer spending power in its core market.",

          "Company Overview & Strategy": "Based on the provided content, Trendyol is a major Turkish e-commerce platform that has evolved from a fashion-centric retailer into a comprehensive online marketplace and \"super-app\" ecosystem. Founded in 2010 with the mission to make fashion accessible, its industry focus has expanded dramatically to include a vast array of categories such as electronics, home and furniture, cosmetics, sporting goods, groceries, and even investment products like gold. The company's business model is that of a large-scale digital marketplace connecting a multitude of producer brands with a broad consumer base, emphasizing an easy, safe, and diverse shopping experience. This model is further diversified with integrated services like \"Trendyol Hızlı Market\" for rapid grocery delivery and \"Trendyol Yemek\" for food delivery, indicating a strategy to become an indispensable part of the customer's daily life. Its primary customer segments are extensive, catering to different tastes and budgets, including fashion-conscious individuals, families, tech enthusiasts, homeowners, and time-pressed consumers seeking convenience. The company's revenue strategy relies on driving high sales volume through frequent discounts and campaigns, supplemented by a loyalty program, \"Trendyol Elite,\" which offers special privileges to retain customers. A notable strategic collaboration is the \"Sepette İyilik\" (Goodness in the Basket) initiative, where Trendyol partners with non-governmental organizations to sell their products, integrating social responsibility directly into its commercial platform.",
          "Technology & Practices": "Based on the provided content, Trendyol positions itself as a technologically advanced e-commerce platform that has expanded beyond its initial fashion focus into a comprehensive digital ecosystem. The company leverages a sophisticated suite of digital tools to enhance user experience and drive business, as evidenced by its detailed cookie policy. This policy outlines the use of performance analytics to measure site traffic and user navigation, targeted advertising technologies that build interest profiles for personalized ads across different sites, and functional tools like live chat and social media integration. The development of specialized services such as \"Trendyol Hızlı Market\" for rapid grocery delivery and \"Trendyol Yemek\" for food ordering demonstrates an investment in logistics and platform technology to create a \"super-app\" that caters to a wide range of consumer needs. From an ethical standpoint, the company actively promotes a social responsibility initiative called \"Sepette İyilik\" (Goodness in the Basket), which provides a marketplace for non-governmental organizations to sell their products, thereby creating a \"chain of help\" and fostering social consciousness. This program indicates a practice of using its commercial platform for social good. However, the provided text does not contain specific information regarding environmental sustainability practices, such as commitments to carbon-neutral operations, sustainable packaging, or eco-friendly sourcing.",
          "Reputation & Team": "Based on the provided information, Trendyol has cultivated a robust and positive reputation as a dominant e-commerce force within Turkey. The company presents itself as one of the nation's most significant online shopping destinations, founded with an accessible mission to democratize fashion for all tastes and budgets. Its brand strength is further solidified by a massive and diverse product catalog that spans from apparel and electronics to groceries and even investment gold, positioning it as an indispensable one-stop shop. The public image is significantly enhanced by socially responsible initiatives like \"Sepette İyilik\" (Goodness in the Basket), which supports non-governmental organizations and fosters a sense of community and purpose beyond pure commerce. Geographically, all available content points to a concentrated and deeply rooted presence in the Turkish market, with the website and its messaging tailored specifically to a Turkish-speaking audience. In stark contrast, there is a complete absence of information regarding the company's management team. The provided text offers no visibility into the founders, executives, or their expertise, focusing entirely on the corporate brand, its services, and its relationship with consumers, suggesting a strategy where the brand itself is the primary public-facing entity.",
          "SWOT Summary": "Based on the provided information, Trendyol exhibits a strong market position rooted in its extensive and diversified offerings, which constitute its core strength. The platform serves as a comprehensive one-stop shop, featuring a vast range of categories from fashion, electronics, and home goods to unique items like investment gold, catering to a wide demographic with varied budgets and a broad range of sizes. This product diversity is further enhanced by an integrated ecosystem of services, including \"Trendyol Hızlı Market\" for groceries, \"Trendyol Yemek\" for food delivery, and the \"Trendyol Elite\" loyalty program, which collectively foster customer convenience and brand loyalty. The company also strengthens its brand image through corporate social responsibility with its \"Sepette İyilik\" initiative. However, a notable weakness is suggested by the repeated \"Aradığın içeriğe şu an ulaşılamıyor\" (The content you are looking for is currently unavailable) message, indicating potential technical instability or inventory management issues that could disrupt the user experience. Looking forward, Trendyol has significant opportunities for growth by leveraging its sophisticated data analytics, as detailed in its cookie policy, to further personalize user experiences and optimize its targeted advertising model. The existing success of its service verticals in grocery and food delivery also presents a clear opportunity to expand into other adjacent markets. Conversely, the company faces external threats, primarily from intense competition within the e-commerce sector and the growing global concern over data privacy. Its reliance on user data for personalization and advertising makes it vulnerable to stricter privacy regulations and user opt-outs, which could limit the effectiveness of its marketing strategies and core functionalities.",
          "Weekly Activity Summary": "Based on the provided information, a specific summary of Trendyol's activities over the past week cannot be generated as the content is general and not time-sensitive.

It details the wide variety of categories available, including fashion, cosmetics, electronics, home goods, and even specialized services like Trendyol Fast Market for groceries and Trendyol Yemek for food delivery. The content also highlights the company's corporate social responsibility through its \"Sepette İyilik\" program and customer loyalty benefits via Trendyol Elite.

The company's primary industry focus is comprehensive retail, operating a business model that extends far beyond a traditional grocery, encompassing a wide array of products including food, household necessities, electronics, stationery, and apparel to fulfill nearly all consumer needs under one roof. Its strategy is anchored in a multi-channel approach, leveraging both expansive physical stores and a sophisticated e-commerce platform, which is highlighted by features like recipe-to-cart functionality and a focus on secure online transactions. Migros targets a broad consumer market as its main customer segment, while also catering to business clients through dedicated services like \"Migros Toptan\" (Wholesale) and corporate card sales. The company's revenue strategy is driven by direct sales across these physical, online, and B2B channels. Key to its overarching strategy is a significant investment in technology and information systems to maintain a competitive edge, a deep commitment to stakeholder satisfaction—including customers, employees, and suppliers—and a strong emphasis on human resources, viewing employee development and well-being as a critical component for achieving its strategic goals and sustaining its market leadership.",
          "Technology & Practices": "Based on the provided information, Migros Ticaret positions itself as a technological pioneer in Turkey's modern retail sector, integrating a range of digital tools and forward-thinking practices into its operations. The company's commitment to technology is explicitly stated in its corporate messaging, highlighting investments in information technology as a key driver for competitive advantage and customer benefit. This is tangibly demonstrated through its comprehensive e-commerce platform, which features innovative, user-centric tools like \"Aklımda Bir Tarif Var,\" allowing customers to seamlessly convert recipes into shopping cart items. This digital ecosystem is further supported by a focus on \"Secure Shopping,\" the use of electronic archiving systems (\"E-Arşiv\"), and a multi-platform social media presence to engage with its audience. Alongside these technological advancements, Migros exhibits a strong commitment to ethical and sustainable practices. The company's website prominently features extensive documentation on data protection and privacy, including a \"Policy on the Protection and Processing of Personal Data\" and a \"Cookie Information Text,\" indicating a rigorous approach to ethical data handling.

          "Reputation & Team": "Based on the provided information, Migros Ticaret has cultivated a strong and reputable brand image within its primary market. The company positions itself as a pioneer in Turkey's modern retail sector, leveraging 70 years of experience to foster an identity centered on customer satisfaction, innovation, and quality. This public image is reinforced through its website, which highlights commitments to sustainability, secure shopping, and customer service, and is further supported by an active presence across major social media platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Geographically, all available information, from its Istanbul headquarters address to its Turkey-specific social media handles and \".com.tr\" domain, points to a concentrated operational presence within Turkey. However, the provided content offers no visibility into the company's management team; no specific executives are named, nor is there any information regarding their individual expertise or leadership background.

          "SWOT Summary": "Based on the provided information, Migros exhibits considerable strengths as a foundational pioneer in Turkey's modern retail sector, leveraging its 70-year legacy to build significant brand equity and customer trust. This market leadership is supported by a broad and diverse product offering, positioning the company as a comprehensive one-stop-shop for consumers. Internally, Migros demonstrates a strong commitment to its human capital through dedicated development and motivation policies, and maintains a competitive advantage by investing heavily in information technology and innovative practices. A potential weakness, however, may lie in the execution of its social media strategy, as the provided content from platforms like Twitter and Instagram suggests technical inaccessibility or a lack of engaging public-facing content, potentially limiting its digital reach. Nevertheless, this digital landscape presents a significant opportunity for growth; by enhancing its social media engagement and further developing its e-commerce capabilities, such as the \"recipe-to-cart\" feature, Migros can capture a larger share of the online market. Further opportunities exist in expanding its B2B channels through \"Migros Toptan\" and corporate sales. The primary threats are inherent to its operational model: a deep reliance on technology creates vulnerability to system disruptions, while the constant emphasis on innovation underscores the persistent pressure from a highly competitive retail environment that necessitates continuous effort to maintain its market leadership.",

          "Company Overview & Strategy": "Based on the provided information, Çiçeksepeti.com presents itself as a pioneering technology and e-commerce company that has strategically evolved from a specialized online florist into a comprehensive marketplace. Founded in 2006 by Emre Aydın, the company's initial focus was to modernize the floral and gift-giving sector in Turkey, establishing a dominant position through a vast network of local florists and a commitment to same-day delivery. Its business model is fundamentally a tech-driven marketplace, leveraging a network of over 55,000 vendors to offer a wide array of products without holding extensive inventory, a strategy underpinned by strong logistics and a \"powerful distribution network.\" The company's primary revenue strategy is likely commission-based, taking a percentage from sales facilitated through its platform, supplemented by direct sales from its proprietary edible arrangement brand, Bonnyfood. Since 2019, Çiçeksepeti has significantly broadened its industry focus beyond its core gifting and floral heritage to include categories such as electronics, home goods, fashion, and even pet supplies, transforming into a one-stop online shop. This expansion targets a broad customer segment, ranging from individuals seeking last-minute, emotionally resonant gifts for special occasions to general consumers looking for everyday items, all of whom value convenience and rapid delivery. The company's key strategic collaborations are not with single corporate entities but with its extensive network of florists and vendors, which forms the backbone of its service delivery across more than 70 cities in Turkey. A notable aspect of its growth strategy is its successful international expansion into Mexico under the brand name \"LolaFlora,\" indicating a clear ambition to replicate its domestic success in new markets.",
          "Technology & Practices": "Based on the provided information, Çiçeksepeti operates as a pioneering technology company that leverages a sophisticated digital infrastructure to dominate the floral and gifting market. Its core technology is a user-friendly marketplace platform that connects a vast network of over 55,000 vendors with a broad customer base, extending far beyond its origins as an Istanbul florist. This platform is supported by a robust logistics and distribution system enabling key service features like same-day delivery across more than 70 cities in Turkey, a critical component of its value proposition. The company utilizes digital tools such as a mobile app, QR code promotions, and data analytics, referencing SimilarWeb metrics to benchmark its global leadership in web traffic. Technologically, its user experience is enhanced by features like visual order confirmation and 24/7 customer support, while platform integrity is maintained through security measures like bot verification. From an ethical standpoint, the company emphasizes a commitment to creating value for employees, customers, and business partners, as evidenced by its \"Best Employer Brand\" awards from LinkedIn, a formal Customer Policy, and a focus on Product Safety. Its marketplace model inherently supports a wide array of local businesses and artisans. However, while the company’s business revolves around natural products, the provided content does not offer specific details regarding its environmental or sustainable practices, such as sourcing or packaging policies.",
          "Reputation & Team": "Based on the provided information, Çiçeksepeti has cultivated a formidable reputation as a pioneering technology company and the undisputed leader in Turkey's floral and gifting sector. The company’s brand strength is consistently reinforced through its self-proclamation as \"Türkiye'nin en geniş çiçekçi ağı\" (Turkey's largest florist network) and is substantiated by external validation, including its status as the world's most visited floral website according to SimilarWeb data and prestigious \"Best Employer Brand\" awards from LinkedIn Turkey. This cultivates a strong public image of a reliable, innovative, and dominant marketplace. The company's geographical presence is extensive, having strategically expanded from its origins as an Istanbul florist to a nationwide operation covering over 70 cities with a network of more than 55,000 vendors, alongside a significant international footprint in Mexico through its subsidiary brand, LolaFlora. While details on the broader management team are not extensively provided, the leadership has clear visibility through its founder, Emre Aydın, lending a distinct identity and history to the firm since its 2006 inception. The combination of a visible founder, industry accolades, and significant market penetration points to a highly-regarded company driven by a competent and forward-thinking team.",
          "SWOT Summary": "Based on the provided information, Çiçeksepeti.com demonstrates significant strengths as a market leader, yet faces notable challenges and opportunities inherent in its business model. The company's primary strength lies in its dominant position within the Turkish floral and gifting market, built upon an extensive nationwide network of over 55,000 vendors and a sophisticated logistics system enabling same-day delivery. This operational prowess, combined with strong brand recognition and a loyal customer base cultivated since 2006, provides a formidable competitive advantage. Furthermore, its strategic diversification from a specialized florist into a broader marketplace for electronics, home goods, and more, alongside its successful international expansion into Mexico with the LolaFlora brand, highlights a robust and scalable business strategy. However, this reliance on a vast third-party vendor network presents a key weakness, creating potential for inconsistencies in product quality and customer service, which could tarnish its premium brand reputation. Opportunities for growth are abundant, particularly in replicating its international expansion model in other emerging markets, further broadening its marketplace categories, and leveraging its vast customer data for enhanced personalization and new service offerings. Concurrently, the company faces significant threats from intense competition by larger e-commerce generalists, economic volatility that could suppress consumer spending on non-essential gifts, and the ever-present logistical and reputational risks associated with last-minute, high-stakes deliveries for special occasions.",
          "Weekly Activity Summary": "Based on the provided information, there are no specific announcements, posts, or activities to summarize for Çiçeksepeti's activity over the past week. The available content consists of general, evergreen descriptions of the company's business model and history, rather than time-sensitive updates.

The core of its digital practice is the use of cookies and similar tracking technologies, not just for essential site functionality but as a powerful engine for a complex advertising and analytics ecosystem. This technology facilitates the collection of personal information, including granular data like site visit metrics and comprehensive \"Amazon Store sipariş geçmişi\" (order history), to build detailed user profiles. These profiles are then leveraged for \"İlgi Alanına Dayalı Tanıtımlar\" (Interest-Based Ads), product development, and the creation of \"kitle bilgileri\" (audience insights). The system's complexity is underscored by the involvement of numerous \"üçüncü taraf\" (third parties), creating a vast network where user data is shared and processed. Ethically, Amazon.com.tr operates within a framework of regulatory compliance, offering transparency through detailed legal documents like the \"Aydınlatma Bildirimi\" (Privacy Notice) and \"Çerez Bildirimi\" (Cookie Notice). It provides users with explicit controls, such as the options to \"Reddet\" (Reject) or \"Kişiselleştirin\" (Customize), and the ability to change preferences at any time. However, this practice is fundamentally rooted in the commodification of user behavior for commercial advantage, raising ethical questions about the extent of data-driven user profiling and influence.

The website content, sourced from `amazon.com.tr` and composed in Turkish, definitively confirms the company's operational presence in the Turkish market. The brand itself is Amazon, a globally recognized powerhouse, which inherently possesses immense brand strength and a well-established corporate image. The text, a detailed and legally formal cookie and data privacy notice, supports the perception of a large, sophisticated, and legally compliant organization, which is a key aspect of its corporate reputation. However, this content offers no insight into the public's specific perception, customer satisfaction, or brand image within the Turkish context. The complete absence of any \"SOCIAL MEDIA\" content is a critical omission, as this would be a primary source for gauging public sentiment. Furthermore, the provided text offers absolutely no information regarding the management team's visibility or expertise, either at the global or local Turkish level, making any assessment in this area impossible.",
          "SWOT Summary": "Based on the provided website content, a detailed SWOT analysis of Amazon.com.tr reveals a company deeply invested in a data-centric business model. The company's primary strengths lie in its sophisticated data collection and personalization capabilities, as evidenced by its use of personal information like order history and site visit metrics to tailor advertisements and improve the shopping experience. This is supported by a robust technical infrastructure that includes a large network of 101 third-party partners for advertising and product development, as well as a transparent, albeit complex, framework for legal compliance through detailed privacy and cookie notices. However, these very systems expose certain weaknesses; the reliance on a dense, intrusive cookie consent dialog creates initial user friction, and the business model's effectiveness is inherently weakened by its dependence on user consent, as the prominent \"Reject\" option could significantly limit data acquisition. Opportunities for the company are substantial, primarily in leveraging its vast data analytics to further dominate the Turkish e-commerce market and build significant customer trust by positioning itself as a leader in privacy-conscious practices. Conversely, Amazon faces significant external threats, most notably from evolving data privacy regulations that could curtail its data collection methods. Furthermore, growing public awareness of data privacy and \"cookie fatigue\" may lead more users to opt out of tracking, while any misuse of sensitive customer data by Amazon or its partners could cause severe reputational damage and legal repercussions, threatening its standing in the market.",

The company's industry focus covers multiple key retail sectors, including high-value categories like electronics and jewelry, as well as fast-moving consumer goods such as innovative skincare, fashion, and home improvement items. Its main customer segment appears to be value-conscious and deal-seeking consumers who are responsive to frequent discounts, coupons, and gamified offers like \"Spin the Wheel.\" A core element of its business model and revenue strategy is facilitating purchases of higher-priced items through accessible financing, as evidenced by promotions offering multi-month installment plans for electronics and interest-free installments for gold jewelry. This suggests a business model that not only connects sellers with buyers but also partners with financial entities to lower the barrier to purchase. The platform also emphasizes logistics and personalization, encouraging users to select their location for same-day delivery and localized deals. While social media presence is established, a notable collaboration explicitly mentioned is with the brand Adidas, indicating a strategy of partnering with major brands to provide exclusive discounts and solidify its market position.",
          "Technology & Practices": "Based on the provided content, n11.com utilizes a suite of established e-commerce technologies and digital practices focused on enhancing customer experience and driving sales, though the materials offer no insight into the company's ethical or sustainable initiatives. Technologically, the platform employs location-based personalization, allowing users to select their location (\"Konum seçerek\") to access same-day delivery and region-specific discounts, which points to a sophisticated logistics and inventory management system. The company leverages various digital tools for customer engagement and conversion, such as gamified promotions like \"Çarkı Çevir, Kap Kuponu\" (Spin the Wheel, Grab a Coupon) and targeted discounts on specific product categories like electronics and skincare. Furthermore, n11.com integrates financial technology by offering installment plans (\"9 Aya Varan Taksit\"), a common practice to increase purchasing power. The presence of a \"Verifying you are human\" message indicates the use of security measures like CAPTCHA to prevent bot activity.

The website content portrays a competitive and dynamic public image, characterized by aggressive promotional tactics such as installment plans, significant discounts, coupons, and gamified shopping experiences like \"spin the wheel.\" The geographical presence of n11.com is unequivocally centered on the Turkish market. This is confirmed by the exclusive use of the Turkish language, the pricing of items in Turkish Lira (TL), and marketing strategies like offering interest-free installments on 22-karat gold bracelets, a practice culturally specific to the region. The emphasis on location-based, same-day delivery further solidifies its operational focus within Turkey. However, the provided text is entirely devoid of any information regarding the company's leadership, executives, or management team, making it impossible to comment on their visibility, expertise, or background.",
          "SWOT Summary": "Based on the provided information, n11.com exhibits a strong strategic focus on aggressive sales promotions and customer incentives, yet appears to be undermined by significant technical and digital marketing weaknesses. The company's primary strengths lie in its diverse and compelling offers, including up to 9-month installments on electronics, substantial percentage-based discounts across various categories like skincare and apparel, and brand-specific promotions with partners like Adidas. Furthermore, n11.com demonstrates a commitment to a personalized user experience through location-based services offering same-day delivery and localized deals, as well as gamified engagement tactics like the \"Spin the Wheel\" coupon feature. However, these strengths are critically weakened by evidence of a poor technical infrastructure, as indicated by the repeated presence of \"page not found\" errors, which can frustrate users and deter sales. This is compounded by an apparently non-functional or inaccessible social media presence, with its Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook feeds failing to provide any meaningful content. Consequently, a major opportunity exists for n11.com to overhaul its digital footprint by fixing website errors to improve the user journey and developing a robust content strategy to leverage its social media channels for customer engagement. Failure to address these issues presents a considerable threat, as competitors with a more seamless technical platform and active social media presence can more easily capture market share, while n11.com's current state risks creating a negative brand perception of being unreliable or outdated.",
          "Weekly Activity Summary": "Based on the provided information, it is not possible to construct a summary of n11.com's specific activities or announcements from the past week. The data from the social media channels (Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook) did not contain any posts from the company; instead, it consisted of browser-level messages indicating that the content could not be loaded, such as JavaScript errors or login prompts. The website content offers a snapshot of the company's ongoing promotional strategies rather than time-sensitive weekly news. This content reveals a broad marketing focus on sales and customer incentives, featuring offers such as up to 9-month installments on electronics, significant discounts of up to 50% on skincare and seasonal items, and brand-specific promotions like a 30% discount on Adidas products. Additionally, the company promotes user engagement through gamified coupon opportunities and highlights service features like location-based same-day delivery."
